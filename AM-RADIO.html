                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        FM and AM Radio waves are commonly used to send information across a wide range of
                        frequencies. AM, or amplitude modulated waves have been used for over a century for
                        broadcasting and various forms of wireless communication. The construction of an Amplitude
                        Modulated wave is simple: the amplitude of a carrier signal is varied in proportion with the
                        information wave and the combined signal is transmitted. These waveforms can be constructed
                        anywhere between 540kHz-1700 kHz, a frequency range that makes it easy to build a circuit that
                        can receive the radio wave and detect the information signal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main goal of our project was to build an AM radio receiver by constructing a circuit
                        that can wirelessly receive signals within the radio frequency range, and filter out the carrier
                        wave to recover the information signal. The main circuit components included: an LC tank
                        circuit with a resonant frequency tuned to 100kHz (the carrier wave frequency), an operational
                        amplifier to increase the voltage of the received signal, and a diode to rectify the signal,
                        and an RC circuit to filter out the carrier wave. The resulting output would then be connected
                        to a speaker which would play the recovered information signal (we chose to use a “Concert A” or
                        a sine wave with a frequency of 440Hz) we intended to receive. Three different circuits named
                        Initial Circuit, Audio Detection Circuit, AM Radio Receiver Circuit were built and data was collected
                        using an Analog Discovery 2 and an application called Waveforms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, the Initial Circuit and the AM Radio Receiver Circuit did not work properly due
                        to a variety of reasons including the lack of an additional operational amplifier, poor choice of
                        location to receive signals, and lack of proper material to build a good LC tank circuit. However,
                        our Audio Detection circuit worked very well and we successfully demodulated
                        our input signal signal and recovered the information signal.

                        By undertaking this project I learned about the fundamentals of amplitude modulation and how to create an AM Radio Reciever.
