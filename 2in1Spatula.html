                    <p>
                        I designed a spatula to 1) hold and/or flip food by clamping it between two surfaces 2) act as a scraper spatula or a flipper
                        spatula depending on use 3) control it using servos and an Arduino for any cooking process.

                    <h2>Design Specifications</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 1. The product must be able to flip food such as burgers, pizza slices, sandwiches, etc...</li>
                        <li> 2. The product must make it easy and reliable for the cooking robot to lift up and scrape food from the pan.</li>
                        <li> 3. The product must be lightweight and be able to carry 1kg of food.</li>
                    </ul>

                                    <p><i><b>Figure 1:</b> scraper spatula at the bottom, flipper spatula to the left, clamp to the right, servo holder at the top left</i></p>

                            </div>
                        </div>

                        The 2 in 1 spatula is equipped with a scraper spatula, flipper spatula and a clamp which are both controlled by a 35kg high Torque Coreless Motor servo.
                        The servos are connected to an Arduino Uno R3 which is used to control the positions of the flipper spatula and the clamp. Every part except the servos
                        are made from ABS plastic resulting in a mass of 578.27 grams. The torque required for the motor to lift 1kg of food is determined to be 2.037 N*m or
                        20.37kg/cm. Using a factor of safety of 1.5, requirement 3 is satisfied with the use of servos that have a 35kg/cm stall torque at 5.0-7.0V operating voltage.
                        <br /><br />
                        In my intial design, I had the flipper spatula about 3mm above the scraper spatula and hence there was no need to have a cut-out of the scraper spatula profile on the
                        flipper spatula. However, I quickly realized that the scraper spatula would hit the pan earlier than the flipper spatula even if the intent was to lift food with the
                        flipper sptula. To overcome this, I made sure both spatulas are on the same level by making a cut-out of the scraper spatula profile on the flipper spatula. To avoid
                        having food fall out of this new gap, I covered it with extra material.
                        <br /><br />
                        One challenge I faced in creating my design was fitting the clamp and the flipper spatula compactly - saving space. I overcame this challenge by positioning the clamp inside the flipper spatula.
                        However, by doing so, I removed 2 of the 4 rods supporting the flipper spatula because they would constrain the motion of the clamp. As a consquence the support given
                        to the flipper spatula by the rods connecting to the servo was insignificantly weakeaned. Nevertheless, cups were placed under the big spatula as a pre-cautionary measure.

                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-3"><span></span></div>
                            <div class="col-6">
                                <span class="image fit">
                                    <img src="images/Scraper.jpg" alt="" />
                                    <p><i><b>Figure 2:</b> scraper spatula configuration</i></p>
                                </span>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        If a given task requires scraping food off of a pan or mixing food, the 2 in 1 spatula can assume the configuration given in figure 2. Note that the
                        middle section of the scraper spatula allows for lifting food of comparable size (to that of the spatula head) by simply pushing it against the food (requirement 2).
                        <br /><br />

                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-3"><span></span></div>
                            <div class="col-6">
                                <span class="image fit">

                            </div>
                        </div>

                        If a given task requires transporting food that is heavy or bigger than the scraper spatula, or carrying large quantity of small food, the 2 in 1 spatula can
                        assume the configuration given in figure 3. Furthermore, if a task requires flipping food, then the spatula can assume the configuration given in figure 4 to
                        clamp the food after which the cooking robot flips the spatula and the food is released by controlling the clamp servo motor (requirements 1 and 2).
