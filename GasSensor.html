                    <h1>Modular Gas Sensor Shell</h1>
                    <p>
                        From June of 2022 to October of 2022, I designed and 3D-printed a modular gas sensor shell (E-nose) that stores a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and 17 gas sensors to 
                        identify chemical signatures (volatile organic compounds, temperature, humidity) humans perceive as ”smells”.

                    <h2>Design Specifications</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 1. There must be uninterrupted gas flow with the gas sensors properly oriented for measurements</li>
                        <li> 2. The product must be modular and lightweight (less than 1kg).</li>
                        <li> 3. The sensors, the wiring and the motherboard should be protected by a modular and easy-to-remove gas sensor shell.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Design Considerations</h2>

                                            The legs at the bottom hold up the gas sensor, so that gas can flow from the bottom of the sensor and exit from the top.

                        The Modular Gas Sensor Shell stores 17 sensors:

                        The data gathered from the sensors listed above during the cooking process will constitutes a chemical signature which is used to analyze the cumulative gas concentration
                        with respect to time. The gas sensor shell stores these sensors, and the hardware which extracts and processes data which includes a custom PCB and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.
                        When designing the gas sensor shell, much consideration was given to requirement 2 and 3. Both the chamber and shell structures have "lips" on top of them, making the structure
                        modular and easy to customize - allowing the use of any amount of gas sensors. One challenge I faced was designing a gas sensor shell that could be removed without removing the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and the motherboard. To overcome this, I used the concept of a dummy node from my data structures
                        and algorithms class: I made a special chamber sturcture that stores the PCB and the Raspberry Pi instead of gas sensors. Furthermore, beacuse the motherboard and Raspberry Pi are on
                        the side of the special chamber they do not interfere with the gas flow. The rest of the chambers have various holes on the side where gas sensors will fit and face towards the gas flow.
                        In addition to all of this, There is a LCD display attached to the topmost gas sensor shell structure which allows the user to view any given gas concentration. There are also rectangular
                        cutouts on the top and bottom caps of the gas sensor shell which is designed to store fans if the gas flow is not fast enough. Finally, All parts are mode from ABS plastic and have a total mass of 830.70 grams.

                                            two I2C connections, and a connection for the temperature and humidty sensor.

                        The PCB is displayed on figure 2. On the left side of the PCB  are functional buttons that are for general purpose use. One set of buttons will be used for triggering
                        data collection and stopping data collection. On the upper rightside of the PCB is a power supply aux for an external power source which will power the sensors because
                        the Raspberry Pi Zero cannot power all the sensors by itself. The bottom part of the PCB are connections for the ADC converters and gas sensors that use the I2C protocol.
                        The bottom rightside of the PCB has optional transistor and pins that will be used to power a fan if gas flow is not sufficient. The cut out holes and rectangles on the
                        top face of the gas sensor shell are made to store the buttons and the power supply aux mentioned here.<br /> <br />

                        Through this experience, I communicated my design ideas to an interdisciplinary research team and executed on my original ideas by 3D printing my designs in the Makers Space at UCLA.
                        I learned how to configure embedded systems (the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W system, Raspbian OS Lite), and familiarized myself with communication protocols (I2C, UART, SPI) and sensor synchronization.
