                    <h1>Modular Gas Sensor Shell</h1>
                    <p>
                        I designed and 3D-printed a modular gas sensor shell (E-nose) that stores a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and 17 gas sensors to 
                        identify chemical signatures (volatile organic compounds, temperature, humidity) humans perceive as "smells".
                    </p>

                <div class="image main">
                    <h2>Design Specifications</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 1. There must be uninterrupted gas flow with the gas sensors properly oriented for measurements</li>
                        <li> 2. The product must be modular and lightweight (less than 1kg).</li>
                        <li> 3. The sensors, the wiring and the motherboard should be protected by a modular and easy-to-remove gas sensor shell.</li>
                    </ul>

                                            The legs at the bottom hold up the gas sensor, so that gas can flow from the bottom of the sensor and exit from the top.

                            The gas sensor shell houses all components required for data collection and processing: the gas sensors mentioned above, Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, a custom PCB, and an LCD display. 
                            The hardware is constructed from ABS plastic, ensuring durability while keeping the overall system lightweight at 830.70 grams. The shell features a modular design with "lips"
                            on the top of both the chamber and shell structures, allowing easy customization and the use of any number of gas sensors (inspired by the concept of linked lists). The topmost
                            node in the structure houses a custom PCB and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W which handles all the data processing instead of collecting data (inpspired by the concept of a dummy node).
                            The shell corresponding to this node houses an LCD display that can be used to visualize the object(s) associated with the measured chemical signature or display relevant gas concentrations.
                            The shell's top and bottom caps include rectangular cutouts designed to accommodate fans, which can be installed to enhance gas flow if necessary.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The system's core functionality relies on multiple gas sensors that collect data to form a chemical signature associated with the underlying process
                            (i.e. cooking food, perfume, smoke, etc...). The chambers are equipped with side holes where the gas sensors are securely mounted, ensuring optimal
                            alignment with the gas flow.

                            The PCB, shown in Figure 2, is designed with a range of functional components to support the system's operations. On the left side, general-purpose
                            buttons are included, with one set designated for starting and stopping data collection. The upper-right corner of the PCB features a power supply
                            auxiliary connector, allowing the use of an external power source to power the sensors, as the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W cannot provide sufficient power
                            for all sensors. At the bottom, the PCB includes connections for ADC converters and gas sensors that communicate using the I2C protocol. Additionally,
                            the bottom-right corner houses optional transistors and pins designed to power a fan, which can be activated if gas flow needs to be enhanced. Cutout
                            holes and rectangular slots on the top face of the gas sensor shell are precisely aligned to accommodate the buttons and power supply auxiliary connector,
                            ensuring a seamless and functional design.

                        Through this experience, I communicated my design ideas to an interdisciplinary research team and executed on my original ideas by 3D printing my designs in the Makers Space at UCLA.
                        I learned how to configure embedded systems (the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W system, Raspbian OS Lite), and familiarized myself with communication protocols (I2C, UART, SPI) and sensor synchronization.
                        Modular Gas Sensor Shell CAD files, links to documentation and python files for each sensor, necessary installations, and the python file
                        that were used to collect data can be found <a href="https://github.com/Selim-Emir-Can/RoMeLa-YORI-Team-ModularGasSensor" target="_blank">here</a>. I have already 3D printed the
                        Modular Gas Sensor for RoMeLa. Here are links a few links about the cooking robot for anyone who is interested:
